# Demand-Prediction-and-Revenue-Forecasting-for-Santander-Bikes-London

Welcome to the Santander Bikes Demand Prediction project repository!

This repository contains the code and documentation for predicting demand and revenue for Santander cycles across London. The project utilizes advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical usage data, cycling patterns, weather conditions, and proximity to bus and tube stations.

Key Features:

Integration of complex datasets from BigQuery using PySpark.
Implementation of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Random Forests, ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM.
Evaluation of model performance with root mean square error (RMSE) metrics.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the environment.
Execute the provided scripts to run the models and generate predictions.
Explore the results and contribute to further improvements.
