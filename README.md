# Demand-Prediction-and-Revenue-Forecasting-for-Santander-Bikes-London

## Santander Bikes Demand Prediction
### Overview
This project aims to predict demand and revenue for Santander cycles across London by analyzing historical usage data and related factors. Advanced statistical and machine learning models are employed to forecast trip duration and revenue, incorporating features such as cycling patterns, weather conditions, and proximity to bus and tube stations.

### Key Features
- Utilizes PySpark for data extraction from BigQuery.
- Implements machine learning models including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Random Forests for demand prediction
- Implements time series models including ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM for revenue forecasting.
- Evaluates model performance using root mean square error (RMSE) metrics.
